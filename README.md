Statistical analysis regarding phylogenetic structure of Brazilian rocky outcrops

This repository contains the dataset and R code used to analyse the phylogenetic structure of Brazilian rocky outcrops for the paper entitled: "Looking similar but all different: phylogenetic signature of Brazilian rocky outcrops and the influence of temperature variability on their phylogenetic structure", published by Jhonny Capichoni Massante and collaborators in Journal of Ecology. The code is written in R Markdown that generates an HTML report. If you have any question, please reach out through email: jhonny.massante@ut.ee.
