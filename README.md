Statistical analysis regarding phylogenetic structure of Brazilian rocky outcrops

This repository contains the dataset and R code used to analyse the phylogenetic structure of Brazilian rocky outcrops for the paper entitled: "Looking similar but all different: phylogenetic signature of Brazilian rocky outcrops and the influence of temperature variability on their phylogenetic structure", published by Jhonny Capichoni Massante and collaborators in Journal of Ecology. The code is written in R Markdown and generates an HTML report. If you want to use the full code or part of it in your publication, please refer to <a href="https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/647859587"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/647859587.svg" alt="DOI"></a>.  you have any question, please reach out through email: jhonny.massante@ut.ee.
